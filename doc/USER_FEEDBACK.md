30. •	No default game
o	Game selection opens an empty window
o	Settings also opens up an empty window
o	Actually opened up in a separate window behind the game
•	Key preferences used to work and now it doesn’t
•	Finally found the load window….looks tough when it’s blackened out
•	Can map same keys to the same button
o	Finally figured how to play
•	Went straight through the brick
o	Stuck in the middle of a brick
•	Tried to make movements that didn’t conform to the normal pattern
o	Went off the end once the level didn’t change
o	“Minimap might be nice”
•	hotkeys for some of the shortcuts
•	froze on game change


•	clicked on entity creator
•	clicked on a couple of dropdowns; was kind of confused
•	background was confusing since it didn’t replicate
•	wasn’t clear how to save a game
o	no way to go back from player to game
•	not clear that things have saved
•	background overwritten by default
•	“nice to load game after you’ve saved”
•	no bounds on the level
o	add a layer of bricks around the end of the level so it’s not limitless
•	background images have different sizes, should normalize to a standard size
•	Bug where you “play” game before you save game, everything pauses/crashes
•	Button to go from “playing” game back to authoring (issue might be fixed with live editing)
•	File browser for images rather than typing file names (ease of access)
•	Scolling during authoring (level is fixed to the size of the editing window)
•	Infinite/looping/autogenerating levels
•	Natural movement
